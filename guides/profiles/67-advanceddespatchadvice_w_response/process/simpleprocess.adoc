= Process with response before the delivery of the goods


This process implies the sending of an Advanced Despatch Advice and return of the Advanced Despatch Advice Response before the actual delivery has taken place. This enables the parties to correct any errors in the transactions and/or the delivery before the goods are transported from the Despatch party.
